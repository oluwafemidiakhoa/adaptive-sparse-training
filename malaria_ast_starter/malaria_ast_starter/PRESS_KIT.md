## 🎙️ Sound Bites

**For Researchers:**
> "By training only on 'hard' samples each epoch, we achieve 60% energy savings while maintaining 96% accuracy. This makes state-of-the-art medical AI accessible to researchers with limited compute budgets."

**For Healthcare:**
> "This technology enables AI-powered malaria diagnostics in rural clinics that struggle with reliable electricity. It's not just about efficiency—it's about accessibility."

**For Sustainability:**
> "Training a single deep learning model can emit as much CO2 as five cars in their lifetimes. Adaptive Sparse Training reduces that footprint by up to 90% without sacrificing performance."

**For Tech Adoption:**
> "We're proving that you don't need expensive infrastructure to deploy cutting-edge AI. A single consumer-grade GPU is enough to train diagnostic-quality models."
