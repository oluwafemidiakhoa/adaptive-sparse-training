## ‚ö†Ô∏è CIFAR-10 Scope and Limitations

### What CIFAR-10 Validates

‚úÖ **Core concept**: Adaptive sample selection maintains accuracy while using 10% of data
‚úÖ **Controller stability**: PI control with EMA smoothing achieves stable 10% activation
‚úÖ **Energy efficiency**: 89.6% reduction in samples processed per epoch

### What CIFAR-10 Does NOT Claim

‚ùå **Not faster than optimized training**: Baseline is unoptimized SimpleCNN. For comparison, [airbench](https://github.com/KellerJordan/cifar10-airbench) achieves 94% accuracy in 2.6s on A100
‚ùå **Not SOTA on CIFAR-10**: This is proof-of-concept validation
‚ùå **Not production baseline**: SimpleCNN used for concept validation

### ImageNet-100 Answers the Real Question

**Does adaptive selection work with modern architectures and large datasets?**

‚úÖ **YES** - Validated with ResNet50 on 126K images with zero accuracy loss

## üéØ What is Adaptive Sparse Training?

AST is an energy-efficient training technique that **selectively processes important samples** while skipping less informative ones:

- üìä **Significance Scoring**: Multi-factor sample importance (loss, intensity, gradients)
- üéõÔ∏è **PI Controller**: Automatically adapts selection threshold to maintain target activation rate
- ‚ö° **Energy Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of compute savings
- üîÑ **Batched Processing**: GPU-optimized vectorized operations

### Traditional Training vs AST

```
Traditional: Process ALL 50,000 samples every epoch
            ‚Üí 100% energy, 100% time

AST:        Process ONLY ~5,200 important samples per epoch
            ‚Üí 10.4% energy, 8.7% time
            ‚Üí Same or better accuracy (curriculum learning effect)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. SundewAlgorithm
PI-controlled adaptive gating with EMA smoothing:
- **Significance Scoring**: Vectorized batch-level computation
- **Threshold Adaptation**: EMA-smoothed PI control with anti-windup
- **Energy Tracking**: Real-time baseline vs actual consumption

#### 2. AdaptiveSparseTrainer
Batched training loop with energy monitoring:
- **Vectorized Operations**: GPU-efficient batch processing
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Prevents zero-activation failures
- **Live Statistics**: Real-time activation rate and energy savings

### Key Innovations

#### EMA-Smoothed PI Controller
```python
# Reduces noise from batch-to-batch variation
activation_rate_ema = Œ± * current_rate + (1-Œ±) * previous_ema

# Stable threshold update
error = activation_rate_ema - target_rate
threshold += Kp * error + Ki * integral_error
```

#### Improved Anti-Windup
```python
# Only accumulate integral within bounds
if 0.01 < threshold < 0.99:
    integral_error += error
    integral_error = clamp(integral_error, -50, 50)
else:
    integral_error *= 0.90  # Decay when saturated
```

#### Fallback Mechanism
```python
# Prevent catastrophic training failure
if num_active == 0:
    # Train on 2 random samples to maintain gradient flow
    active_samples = random_subset(batch, size=2)
```

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Significance Scoring

Multi-factor sample importance computation:

```python
# Vectorized computation (GPU-efficient)
loss_norm = losses / losses.mean()      # Relative loss
std_norm = std_intensity / std_intensity.mean()  # Intensity variation

# Weighted combination (70% loss, 30% intensity)
significance = 0.7 * loss_norm + 0.3 * std_norm
```

### PI Controller Configuration

Optimized for 10% activation rate:

```python
Kp = 0.0015   # 5√ó increase for faster convergence
Ki = 0.00005  # 25√ó increase for steady-state accuracy
EMA Œ± = 0.3   # 30% new, 70% old (noise reduction)
```

### Energy Computation

```python
baseline_energy = batch_size * energy_per_activation
actual_energy = num_active * energy_per_activation +
                num_skipped * energy_per_skip

savings_percent = (baseline - actual) / baseline * 100
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Guide

### Target Activation Rate

```python
# Conservative (easier convergence)
target_activation_rate = 0.10  # 10% activation, ~90% energy savings

# Aggressive (higher speedup)
target_activation_rate = 0.06  # 6% activation, ~94% energy savings
# Requires more careful tuning
```

### PI Controller Gains

```python
# For 10% target (recommended)
adapt_kp = 0.0015
adapt_ki = 0.00005

# For 6% target (advanced)
adapt_kp = 0.0008
adapt_ki = 0.000002
# Requires longer convergence
```

### Training Duration

```python
# Short experiments (proof of concept)
epochs = 10  # ~43% accuracy

# Medium training (recommended)
epochs = 40  # ~61% accuracy

# Full convergence
epochs = 100  # ~70% accuracy (estimated)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Energy savings showing 0%
**Cause**: Significance scoring selecting all samples
**Fix**: Check for constant terms in significance formula, ensure proper normalization

### Issue: Activation rate stuck at wrong value
**Cause**: PI controller error sign inverted or gains mistuned
**Fix**: Verify `error = activation - target`, adjust Kp/Ki

### Issue: Threshold oscillating wildly
**Cause**: Per-sample updates or insufficient smoothing
**Fix**: Use batch-level updates, increase EMA Œ±

### Issue: Training fails with Loss=0.0
**Cause**: All batches have num_active=0
**Fix**: Enable fallback mechanism (train on random samples)

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more details.
