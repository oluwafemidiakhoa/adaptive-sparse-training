# ImageNet Validation Plan for Adaptive Sparse Training

## üéØ Goal

Validate that Adaptive Sparse Training (AST) works on ImageNet with modern architectures (ResNet, ViT), addressing the main community criticism: "Does this scale beyond CIFAR-10?"

---

## üìä What Success Looks Like

**Minimum viable result:**
- ImageNet accuracy maintained (within 1-2% of baseline) while training on 10-20% of samples
- 5-10√ó training speedup
- 80-90% energy savings
- Stable PI controller convergence

**Stretch goal:**
- Better accuracy than baseline (curriculum learning effect)
- Compare to airbench-style optimizations
- Test on multiple architectures (ResNet50, ViT-B/16)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup (1-2 weeks)

**1. Environment:**
- [ ] Cloud GPU setup (AWS/GCP/Lambda Labs)
  - Need: A100 or V100 (ImageNet requires serious compute)
  - Budget: ~$50-200 for experiments
- [ ] Download ImageNet dataset (~150GB)
  - Academic access through university/Kaggle
- [ ] Set up efficient data loading pipeline

**2. Baseline:**
- [ ] Implement ResNet50 baseline (standard PyTorch)
- [ ] Train for 90 epochs (standard ImageNet protocol)
- [ ] Record: accuracy, training time, samples processed
- [ ] Use best practices: mixed precision, distributed training

**3. Port AST to ImageNet:**
- [ ] Adapt CIFAR-10 code to handle 224√ó224 images
- [ ] Adjust batch sizes for GPU memory
- [ ] Update significance scoring for larger images
- [ ] Test PI controller with ImageNet data distribution

### Phase 2: Experiments (2-3 weeks)

**Experiment 1: Baseline comparison**
- Train ResNet50 on 100% of ImageNet (baseline)
- Train ResNet50 with AST on 10% selection
- Compare: accuracy, time, energy

**Experiment 2: Activation rate sweep**
- Test different target rates: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%
- Find optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency

**Experiment 3: Architecture comparison**
- [ ] ResNet50 with AST
- [ ] ResNet101 with AST
- [ ] ViT-B/16 with AST (if time permits)
- Validate that AST generalizes across architectures

**Experiment 4: Significance scoring ablation**
- Test different scoring methods:
  - Loss only
  - Loss + intensity (current)
  - Loss + gradient magnitude
  - Loss + prediction entropy
- Find best significance metric for ImageNet

### Phase 3: Analysis (1 week)

**1. Results compilation:**
- Create comprehensive tables comparing all experiments
- Visualize: accuracy curves, threshold evolution, activation rates
- Statistical significance testing

**2. Comparison to related work:**
- [ ] Curriculum learning baselines
- [ ] Active learning methods
- [ ] Optimized training (airbench-style)

**3. Failure analysis:**
- Which ImageNet classes benefit most from AST?
- Which classes suffer?
- Does AST work better on fine-grained vs. coarse categories?

## üí∞ Budget Estimate

**Compute costs:**
- Baseline training (90 epochs ResNet50): ~8-12 GPU hours = $20-40
- AST training (90 epochs, 10% samples): ~1-2 GPU hours = $5-10
- Ablation studies (5-10 runs): ~5-10 GPU hours = $15-30
- **Total: $50-100** (very reasonable!)

**Time investment:**
- Setup + implementation: 20-30 hours
- Running experiments: 10-20 GPU hours (can run overnight)
- Analysis + writing: 10-15 hours
- **Total: ~40-60 hours over 4-6 weeks**

---

## üöß Potential Challenges

### Challenge 1: Computational cost
**Problem:** ImageNet training is expensive
**Solution:**
- Use smaller subset first (ImageNet-100 or ImageNet-1K subset)
- Partner with university lab for GPU access
- Apply for cloud credits (AWS, GCP offer research grants)
- Use Kaggle P100 GPUs (free tier)

### Challenge 2: Different data distribution
**Problem:** ImageNet has long-tail distribution, CIFAR-10 is balanced
**Solution:**
- May need to adjust PI gains for ImageNet
- Test class-balanced significance scoring
- Validate on both balanced and imbalanced subsets

### Challenge 3: Memory constraints
**Problem:** 224√ó224 images + large models = GPU OOM
**Solution:**
- Use gradient accumulation (smaller effective batch size)
- Mixed precision training (FP16)
- Smaller batch size with more frequent threshold updates

### Challenge 4: Longer training time
**Problem:** ImageNet takes days to train, slower iteration
**Solution:**
- Start with 30-epoch runs (faster feedback)
- Use learning rate warmup + early stopping
- Run multiple experiments in parallel
