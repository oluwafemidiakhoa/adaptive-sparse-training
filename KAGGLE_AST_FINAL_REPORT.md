## Implementation Details

### Architecture

**File**: `KAGGLE_VIT_BATCHED_STANDALONE.py` (850+ lines)

**Core Components**:
1. **SundewAlgorithm** - PI-controlled adaptive gating with EMA smoothing
2. **AdaptiveSparseTrainer** - Batched training loop with energy tracking
3. **SimpleCNN** - Model architecture (3 conv layers + classifier)
4. **Significance Scoring** - Multi-factor sample importance computation

### Key Innovations

#### 1. EMA-Smoothed PI Controller (Lines 62-154)

```python
# Exponential moving average of activation rate
self.activation_rate_ema = (
    self.threshold_ema_alpha * activation_rate +
    (1 - self.threshold_ema_alpha) * self.activation_rate_ema
)

# PI control based on smoothed activation rate
error = self.activation_rate_ema - self.config.target_activation_rate
proportional = self.config.adapt_kp * error
new_threshold = self.threshold + proportional + self.config.adapt_ki * self.integral_error
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces noise from batch-to-batch variation
- Prevents threshold oscillation
- Enables stable convergence to target activation rate

#### 2. Improved Anti-Windup (Lines 145-153)

```python
# Only accumulate integral if within bounds
if 0.01 < new_threshold < 0.99:
    self.integral_error += error
    # Prevent integral from growing too large
    self.integral_error = max(-50, min(50, self.integral_error))
else:
    # Decay integral when at bounds to enable recovery
    self.integral_error *= 0.90
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents integral term runaway
- Enables controller recovery from saturation
- Maintains stability across training phases

#### 3. Fallback Mechanism (Lines 378-403)

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: If no samples activated, train on random subset
if num_active == 0:
    fallback_size = min(2, batch_size)
    random_indices = torch.randperm(batch_size, device=self.device)[:fallback_size]
    active_inputs = inputs[random_indices]
    active_targets = targets[random_indices]
    num_active = fallback_size
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents catastrophic training failure (Loss=0.0 epochs)
- Ensures gradient flow even when threshold too high
- Maintains learning progress throughout training

#### 4. Batched Vectorized Operations (Lines 296-306)

```python
# Vectorized significance computation
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = self.model(inputs)
    losses = self.criterion(outputs, targets)  # [batch_size]
    std_intensity = inputs.std(dim=(1, 2, 3))  # [batch_size]

    # Normalize components
    loss_norm = losses / (losses.mean() + 1e-6)
    loss_norm = torch.clamp(loss_norm, 0, 2) / 2
    std_norm = std_intensity / (std_intensity.mean() + 1e-6)
    std_norm = torch.clamp(std_norm, 0, 2) / 2

    significance = 0.7 * loss_norm + 0.3 * std_norm
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates per-sample Python loops (50,000Ã— slower)
- Full GPU utilization
- Enables real-time energy tracking

### Configuration

**Optimized Hyperparameters** (Lines 263-279, 837-842):

```python
SundewConfig(
    activation_threshold=0.50,        # Balanced starting point
    target_activation_rate=0.10,      # 10% target for stability
    adapt_kp=0.0015,                  # 5Ã— increase for faster convergence
    adapt_ki=0.00005,                 # 25Ã— increase for steady-state
    energy_per_activation=10.0,
    energy_per_skip=0.1,
)

TrainingConfig(
    epochs=40,                        # Extended for convergence
    lr=1e-4,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)
```

## Problem-Solving Journey

### Critical Issues Resolved

#### Issue 1: Energy Savings Not Visible
**Symptom**: User couldn't see real-time energy savings
**Root Cause**: No display in training loop
**Fix**: Added live energy stats to batch progress (lines 370-375)
**Result**: âœ… Real-time energy monitoring functional

#### Issue 2: 0% Energy Savings
**Symptom**: 100% activation rate, all samples selected
**Root Cause**: Significance formula had constant 0.2 term
**Fix**: Removed constant, proper normalization
**Result**: âœ… 89.4% energy savings achieved

#### Issue 3: PI Controller Inverted
**Symptom**: Activation rate stuck at 20% when target 6%
**Root Cause**: Error calculation backwards (target - activation)
**Fix**: Changed to (activation - target)
**Result**: âœ… Controller converges to target

#### Issue 4: Threshold Oscillation
**Symptom**: Threshold jumping 0.01 â†” 0.95 wildly
**Root Cause**: Per-sample updates (50,000Ã—/epoch)
**Fix**: Refactored to batch-level updates
**Result**: âœ… Stable threshold evolution

#### Issue 5: Catastrophic Training Failure
**Symptom**: Loss=0.0 for entire epochs, no learning
**Root Cause**: num_active=0 batches when threshold high
**Fix**: Fallback mechanism (train 2 random samples)
**Result**: âœ… Continuous learning guaranteed

#### Issue 6: Controller Instability at 10% Target
**Symptom**: Threshold still hitting bounds
**Root Cause**: PI gains tuned for 6% target + per-epoch updates
**Fix**: EMA smoothing + retuned gains + improved anti-windup
**Result**: âœ… Stable convergence to 10.4% activation

## Lessons Learned

### Key Insights

1. **Batching is Critical**: Per-sample processing creates 50,000Ã— overhead. Always vectorize.

2. **Controller Design Matters**: Simple PI control works, but needs:
   - EMA smoothing for noise reduction
   - Proper anti-windup for stability
   - Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

3. **Significance Scoring is Subtle**: Small constant terms or improper normalization breaks gating entirely.

4. **Energy Tracking Must Be Real-Time**: Delayed feedback makes debugging impossible.

5. **Thresholds Saturate**: Controllers naturally hit bounds (0.0, 1.0). Design for recovery, not prevention.

### Best Practices

**For Adaptive Gating**:
- Start with conservative activation rate (10% easier than 6%)
- Use EMA smoothing (Î±=0.3) on noisy signals
- Implement fallback for zero-activation batches
- Clamp integral term to prevent runaway

**For Energy Efficiency**:
- Track both baseline and actual energy
- Display savings in real-time
- Use deque for moving averages
- Compute batch-level metrics

**For Debugging**:
- Print threshold evolution every epoch
- Visualize activation rate over time
- Log controller internal state (integral, proportional)
- Test with synthetic data first
