# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your repository is live but needs some polish to maximize visibility and impact.

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### 1. Add Repository Description
**On GitHub web interface:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/oluwafemidiakhoa/adaptive-sparse-training
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è (Settings icon) next to "About" on the right sidebar
3. Fill in:

**Description (Short):**
```
Energy-efficient deep learning with Adaptive Sparse Training - 89.6% energy savings, 11.5√ó speedup on CIFAR-10
```

**Website (Optional but recommended):**
```
https://github.com/oluwafemidiakhoa/adaptive-sparse-training
```

**Topics (Add these tags for discoverability):**
```
machine-learning
deep-learning
energy-efficient
pytorch
adaptive-training
green-ai
sustainable-ai
sparse-training
cifar10
computer-vision
research
open-source
production-ready
ml-infrastructure
efficient-ml
```

4. Check these boxes:
   - ‚úÖ Include in the home page

### 2. Why Topics Matter
Topics make your repo discoverable when people search:
- `green-ai` ‚Üí Green AI researchers find you
- `energy-efficient` ‚Üí Sustainability-focused devs find you
- `pytorch` ‚Üí PyTorch community sees you
- `production-ready` ‚Üí Industry practitioners find you

### 3. Add Social Preview Image
1. Go to Settings (top menu)
2. Scroll to "Social preview"
3. Upload: **AST_Social_Media_Visual.png** (the image we created)
4. This shows when people share your repo on Twitter/LinkedIn

### 4. Pin Important Files
Create a `.github/` folder with key files:

**Create `.github/FUNDING.yml`** (if you want sponsorships):
```yaml
# These are supported funding model platforms
github: [oluwafemidiakhoa]
patreon: # your patreon username
ko_fi: # your ko-fi username
```

**Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:**
Makes it easier for people to report issues professionally.

**Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:**
Helps contributors submit good PRs.

### 5. Add Shields/Badges
Your README already has some, but ensure they're working:
- ![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)
- ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-2.0+-ee4c2c.svg)
- ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

Add more:
- ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/oluwafemidiakhoa/adaptive-sparse-training)
- ![Forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/oluwafemidiakhoa/adaptive-sparse-training)
- ![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/oluwafemidiakhoa/adaptive-sparse-training)

### 6. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
Host documentation as a website:
1. Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch ‚Üí `main`
3. Your docs will be at: https://oluwafemidiakhoa.github.io/adaptive-sparse-training
